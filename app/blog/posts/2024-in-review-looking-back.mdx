I've seen a quite a few post recapping the last year, so why not do the same? For those who not like long post, here is the TLDR:

**Personal Milestones:**
- Got Engaged
- Got Married

**Career Milestones:**
- 1 Year in Cyber/Sec Industry 

**Certifications:**
- Sec +
- SC-300 (Certified Microsoft IAM Admin)
- AWC Certified Cloud Practitioner
- Terraform 003 (Certified Associate)
- GitHub Foundations

For those that do enjoy reading here is my review of 2024. 

First off, the biggest highlight was getting engaged to and marrying my best friend Makenzie Jenkins! I am so blessed to be able to call myself her husband, and grateful to have such an amazing wife who supports me in my career and personal goals and ambitions. 

As for my career, this October marked my 1 year anniversary in leaving the tech support role and joining the sec/cyber industry. I am so incredibly grateful to Alex Whiteaker, MBA, CISSP and Justin Kownack for taking a chance on me. I have learned so much more than I could have hoped to this past year, and incredibly excited to see what's next in my career. 

For certifications, 2024 was another year of regular cert acquisition. The Sec + and the SC-300 were definitely my top highlights as they most aligned with my role as an IAM Analyst. Beyond that, getting exposure to both AWS and Terraform with the CCP and 003 really excited me about building my own applications and deploying them in the cloud. 

Looking forward to next year, my goal is to complete my software developer courses I have lined up and building a portfolio of both skills and projects that demonstrate my ability to be a full stack software developer. (If you don't already, you can follow me on LinkedIn or Github to check my progress). 

Thank you to everyone who supported me over this past year, I am incredibly excited to see where God takes me in 2025!
