A little post mid-year update on what I've been working on. Here's the TLDR recap:

- Started the year with Web Dev (React)
- Got deeper into Azure Compute and Networking, passed the AZ 104 exam. 
- Studied Azure Architecture (intent on taking AZ 305 in the future)
- Got back into Web Dev, learning TypeScript and Jest (also GH Actions)
- Built a mobile app with React Native and Expo
- Learned Next.js, deployed a few projects with Vercel
- Rebuilt noahjenkins.com, check it out!

Long story short, I've been very heavy into Web Dev this year. I still plan to keep building websites (and mobile apps). With that, I'm starting the next phase of my learning, AI!

I am starting by learning how to build my own agents (and crew of agents) with CrewAI! (Thank you Preston McCauley for recommending CrewAI at the AgentCon in Dallas!) I've already started and man is it an awesome tool!

After that, my current plan is to go for the AI-900 (AI fundamentals) and AI-102 (Azure AI Engineer)certifications from Microsoft, but who knows, if there is anything I have learned this year, it's that my learning plans are always changing. 

Excited to show you what agents' workflows I am able to build soon!
